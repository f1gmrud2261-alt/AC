  <p><i>Everyone had read the book many time but anyone thought what would be history of it. let me tell it</i></p>
  <p><i>You will say that if there was no paper then how could the book contain the knowledge and science given by the sages and saints.Back then, unlike today, there wasn't the hustle and bustle of the population, nor the rush to get things done. Making a living was difficult, but life was simple. Without the need to focus on multiple things at once, people had to make everything they needed themselves in the village, as their memory was sharper than their travels.</i></p>
  <p><i>People memorized the teachings of the sages of their time. Gurus passed this knowledge on to their disciples, and ancestors to their descendants.</i></p>
 <p><i>This tradition continued, generation after generation. People learned from each other by listening and singing. Thus, the journey of all literature continued.</i></p>

 <p><i>Knowledge and science that was difficult to remember was written down on wooden blocks, tablets, etc. Pictures were also used to preserve important things. One such picture, six thousand years old, has been found in Mesopotamia.</i></p>

 <p><i>Raw clay tablets were made and religious and moral sayings were written on them. This way, important verses were easily memorized. Therefore, literature was composed in reading. Oral and auditory accounts were also documented. These tablets were then baked and preserved. Tradition has enabled our Suti and Smriti to transmit ancient knowledge to us.</i></p>

 <p><i>The world's first scripts were invented, followed by the cogger. The Finnish people invented the first systematic alphabet, translating spoken words into written letters. They accomplished this feat 150 years before Christ.</p></i>

 <p><i>It was first adopted by the Greeks. New improvements were made to it. Letter shapes were simplified. Letters with incomplete shapes were also removed. The work on tree, tree leaves, etc. came later.</i></p>
  <p><i>In Madhya Pradesh, a water plant was used to write the messages of saints. Several leaves were crushed into strips. This strip was then wrapped around a wooden block. This is why the paper used for writing is also called paper.

 The Emitras, all of them together, cut unknown Roman nails into a single shape and made a bundle of these written letters. By joining them, the world's first book was born.<p><i>India's ancient history was written on birch bark. Peacock feathers were used to create pens. Later, writing on leather became common practice.</i></p>
 <p><i>Started being used.In 1025, the Ghoris introduced paper for books. They melted cloth rags, tree barks, and old fishing nets to create a material suitable for use. This was later called paper. Even today, paper is made from wood chips.

 For nearly six centuries, this invention remained in this region of the East. Once, Arab travellers captured some Chopi artisans making paper. Then, the secret of papermaking was revealed to the outside world.

 The next turning point in the life of the book came in 1439. A German citizen named Johann Pförg invented metal axis type. This method of printing was very slow. It took Gutenberg three years to print 190 copies of the Bible. The biggest benefit of this invention was that book prices fell by more than a quarter. This sparked a desire for reading and writing among ordinary people. Soon, all European countries were printing books.Today, type composing is done by machines instead of by hand. This book you hold is also created using this type composing method. These type composing machines work like typewriters. Today, letterpress printing, lithographic printing, gravure printing, offset printing, and photo-composing machines are now operated by computers.</i></p>
